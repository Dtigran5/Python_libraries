Keras Library

Keras is an open-source, high-level neural network API written in Python. It runs on top of other machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), or Theano and provides a simple and consistent interface to build deep learning models. Keras is designed to enable fast experimentation and is highly user-friendly, making it a popular choice for both beginners and researchers.

The key features of Keras include:

    User-friendly API: Simple and intuitive API for building neural networks quickly.
    Modularity: Keras models are built by stacking layers, making it easy to experiment with different architectures.
    Backend Flexibility: Keras can run on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.
    Preprocessing: Provides utilities for data preprocessing, augmentation, and handling of image, text, and sequence data.
    Supports Multiple Types of Models: Easily build sequential models (a stack of layers) or functional models (more flexible graphs).
    Compatibility with TensorFlow: Fully integrated into TensorFlow, especially after TensorFlow 2.0, where Keras is now TensorFlow’s high-level API.
    Easy Model Training: Simple APIs for training, evaluation, and making predictions.

Key Features:

    High-Level Building Blocks: Simple functions for creating neural networks (with a focus on user experience).
    Pre-trained Models: Access to pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet, and more, via keras.applications.
    Fast Prototyping: Less code and fewer concepts to quickly create models.
    Extensible: Custom layers, models, and optimizers can be added for research.

Table of Most Useful and Important Keras Functions

Sequential() Builds a linear stack of layers for a neural network. model = Sequential([...])
Dense() Fully connected layer in a neural network. Dense(64, activation='relu')
Conv2D() Adds a 2D convolution layer (used in CNNs). Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')
MaxPooling2D() Adds a max-pooling layer to downsample feature maps in CNNs. MaxPooling2D((2, 2))
Flatten() Flattens input to be fed into dense layers (usually used in CNNs). Flatten()
Input() Defines an input layer (used in functional models). input_tensor = Input(shape=(32,))
compile() Configures the model for training (defines loss function, optimizer, and metrics). model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
fit() Trains the model on the training data. model.fit(data, labels, epochs=10)
evaluate() Evaluates the model’s performance on test/validation data. model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels)
predict() Generates predictions on new data based on the trained model. model.predict(new_data)
save() Saves the entire model to disk. model.save('my_model.h5')
load_model() Loads a saved model from disk. new_model = load_model('my_model.h5')
callbacks.EarlyStopping() Stops training early when performance metric stops improving. callbacks=[EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss')]
ImageDataGenerator() Used for data augmentation and real-time data loading for images. ImageDataGenerator(rotation_range=20)
Keras.layers.Embedding() Embedding layer used in NLP models. layers.Embedding(input_dim=10000, output_dim=128)
Keras.layers.LSTM() Long Short-Term Memory layer (used for sequence data). layers.LSTM(64)
Keras.layers.Bidirectional() Bidirectional wrapper for RNNs (applies the RNN forward and backward). Bidirectional(LSTM(64))
Keras.layers.Dropout() Adds dropout for regularization (randomly drops units during training). Dropout(0.5)
Keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer() Tokenizes text into integer sequences for NLP tasks. Tokenizer(num_words=10000)
Keras.applications Provides access to pre-trained models such as VGG16, ResNet, MobileNet, etc. model = Keras.applications.VGG16()
Keras.backend.clear_session() Clears the TensorFlow session to free up memory between model runs. Keras.backend.clear_session()
